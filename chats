OUR SOLUTUON
We have decided to put up an idea where public toilets work automatically with the help of programming.That is it can allocate toilets auotomatically looking whether if it is free or not and receive money that shall be shown in the counter.Automatic cleaning takes palce after va certain amount of time which can be controlled by a loop.Automatic swipers on floor which again works with the help of a loop.


WORKING

1.COUNTER SECTION
before the man enter the toilet he gets a screen between the door where he is aked
a.Gender
b.Purpose(Toilet or bath)
When he choses the option he is allowed to pay the money shown and screen shows the available toilets.
2.He is allowed to enter the toilet
3.After the man leaves the sensor inside the flush tank checks if it is empty.If not flush again goes on.
4.After every certain amount of time (which can be set by a operator based on crowd) the automatic swiper and odour freshner goes on, which works on loop.
5.the seats are also cleaned after every man exits to provide bettewr hygeine.this can be worked according to the time when the flush works.
